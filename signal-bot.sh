# Description: This bash script acts as a signal group chat bot that publishes information about
# group members' individual Worldle scores of the day to a scoreboard hosted on Keep the Score.
# The script runs several times a day (with a cron job) looking for new messages on signal-cli with
# people's Worldle scores from a given group. It then parses the scores into something that can be 
# communicated to the KeepTheScore API in the background.

    # create a variable with a temporary folder where the 'signal-cli receive' output can be stored for analysis
    local tempFolder1 = $(mktemp)

    signal-cli receive --ignore-attachments > "$tempFolder1"
